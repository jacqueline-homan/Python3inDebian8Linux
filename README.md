# Python3inDebian8Linux
Python3 tutorial for Debian 8 Linux users with Sublime text editor
Based on several other Python tutorials that teach Python programming with IDEs like VS, Eclipse, etc. in 
Windows and Mac OS, this tutorial is aimed at Linux users who just want to use the basic text editors they're comfortable with.

## Running the code in the Debian 8 w/ zshell environment 
* You will need to include the 'shebang' line at the top of each file, just like I have in these files
* To make the programs executable: chmod 755 filename.py
* Mac OS users may need to make symlinks. 
* Your shebang line might be different than mine, depending on the path your Python3
interpreter is located.
